# Coordination Center - MaskingEngine Development

Central coordination for MaskingEngine development using SPARC and TDD methodologies.

## Active Development Workflow

### SPARC + TDD Process
1. **Specification**: Define feature requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Test First**: Write failing tests that define expected behavior
3. **Implementation**: Write minimal code to pass tests
4. **Refinement**: Refactor while keeping tests green
5. **Documentation**: Update docs and examples

## Task Queue

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **Complete Test Coverage**
   - Description: Achieve 90%+ test coverage for existing components
   - Status: In Progress
   - Components: regex_detector, masking_engine, sanitizer
   - Approach: TDD - tests written, need to ensure all pass

2. **FastAPI REST Implementation**
   - Description: Build REST API with /sanitize and /rehydrate endpoints
   - Status: Pending
   - Dependencies: Core library tests passing
   - Approach: Write API tests first, then implement

3. **CLI Interface Development**
   - Description: Create command-line interface using Click
   - Status: Pending
   - Dependencies: Core library complete
   - Approach: Define CLI spec, write tests, implement

### Medium Priority
1. **Docker Configuration**
   - Description: Create Dockerfile and docker-compose setup
   - Status: Pending
   - Requirements: Include NER model, optimize size

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Description: GitHub Actions for testing and deployment
   - Status: Pending
   - Requirements: Run tests, linters, build Docker image

### Low Priority
1. **Example Scripts**
   - Description: Create example usage scripts
   - Status: Pending
   - Examples: Basic usage, API client, batch processing
